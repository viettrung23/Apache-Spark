1. **Library Imports**:
   - Imports necessary libraries such as `SparkSession` for managing Spark contexts and `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.

2. **Spark Session Setup**:
   - Initializes a Spark session, which enables the use of Spark DataFrames.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Reads a CSV file (named `baskets.csv`) into a Spark DataFrame for subsequent processing.

4. **Data Preview and Inspection**:
   - Displays the schema and a sample of rows from the DataFrame to get an initial understanding of the data.

5. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
